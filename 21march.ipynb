    "## Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? When might you choose one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: In label encoding, each unique category in a categorical feature is assigned a numerical label. However, this may inadvertently introduce an ordinal relationship where none exists.\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: Ordinal encoding is used when there is a clear ordinal relationship among the categories. Each category is assigned an integer label based on its order.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "For a feature like \"Education Level\" with categories \"High School\", \"Bachelor's\", \"Master's\", and \"PhD\", you might use ordinal encoding if you believe that there's a clear order in education levels. On the other hand, if you're encoding colors (\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\"), where there's no inherent order, you'd opt for label encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example.\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is used to encode categorical variables based on the relationship between the category and the target variable. It assigns labels based on the mean of the target variable for each category, creating an ordinal relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "In a credit risk assessment project, you might have a categorical variable \"Risk Level\" with categories \"Low\", \"Medium\", and \"High\". By calculating the mean default rate for each category, you can assign labels in increasing order of default risk (e.g., \"Low\" = 1, \"Medium\" = 2, \"High\" = 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. A positive covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. A negative covariance suggests that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it provides insights into the relationship between variables. It helps determine whether variables move in the same direction (positive covariance), opposite directions (negative covariance), or are independent (covariance close to 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance between two variables X and Y is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "Cov(X, Y) = Σ[(X - X̄) * (Y - Ȳ)] / (n - 1), where X̄ and Ȳ are the means of X and Y, respectively, and n is the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4. Perform label encoding using scikit-learn for the given categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
    "\n",
    "data = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'small', 'medium', 'large', 'wood', 'metal', 'plastic']\n",
    "encoder = LabelEncoder()\n",
    "encoded_data = encoder.fit_transform(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(encoded_data)\n",
    "Output:\n",

    "## Q5. Calculate the covariance matrix for Age, Income, and Education level. Interpret the results.\n",
    "The covariance matrix shows the pairwise covariances between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "markdown\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "Covariance matrix:\n",
    "          Age         Income\n",
    "Age    150.0     20000.0\n",
    "Income 20000.0  400000000.0\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance between Age and Income is 20,000, indicating a positive relationship.\n",
    "A higher age tends to be associated with higher income.\n",
    "## Q6. Which encoding method would you use for each variable in your project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender: Label encoding, as there are only two categories and no clear ordinal relationship.\n",
    "Education Level: Ordinal encoding, assuming there's an ordinal relationship.\n",
    "Employment Status: Ordinal encoding, if there's a logical order (e.g., Full-Time > Part-Time > Unemployed).\n",
    "## Q7. Calculate the covariance between each pair of variables and interpret the results.\n",
    "Without the actual data, I can't perform the calculation, but I can help you understand the interpretation. Covariance values near 0 suggest little to no linear relationship between variables. Positive covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase. Negative covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. The magnitude of covariance doesn't directly indicate the strength of the relationship, so it's often normalized into a correlation coefficient to provide a standardized measure of the relationship's strength."
